* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parallélisme(LIP)](https://avalon.ens-lyon.fr/) at [École normale supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](http://aveith.github.io/files/AlexandreVeith-CV.pdf).
* My advisors are [Dr. Marcos Assunção](http://marcosassuncao.me/) and [Dr. Laurent Lefèvre](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/laurent.lefevre/) ([INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/)).
* My research topic is "Algorithms for big data analytics".
* I work on placement and optimization problems.
* I like to code.
* I am self-motivated.

# Research Interests
* Elasticity for stream processing applications.
* Modelling the behavior of distributed systems.
* Single- and multi-objective optimization problems.
* (Near) Real-time solutions for big data analytics.
* Machine Learning/Reinforcement learning.
* Edge/FoG computing.
* Internet of Things (IoT) issues.

# Research Activities
* **2016 - present**: Ph.D. in Computer Science.
  * **Title**: Algorithms for big data analytics.
  * **Advisors**: Marcos Assunção and Laurent Lefèvre.
  * **Hosting team**: AVALON-Team in LIP at [ENS-Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/).
  * **Defense**: September 2019.
  * **Approach**: I propose models and solutions for the placement problem of (near)real-time big data analytics on heterogeneous infrastructures addressing the single- and multi-objective optimization problem. In the models, I apply methods from queueing theory, Markov Decision Process(MDP), and Reinforcement Learning(RL). And for the solutions, I consider approaches as series-parallel graphs, Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Temporal Difference Tree Search (TDTS), Q-learning and greedy algorithms.

* **2012 - 2014**: M.Sc. in Computer Science. 
  * **Subject**: Rescheduling and checkpointing as strategies to Bulk Synchornous Parallel (BSP) programs on P2P desktop grids.
  * **Supervisor**: [Rodrigo da Rosa Righi](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4705414D4).
  * **Hosting team**: [Departament of Applied Computing](http://www.unisinos.br/global/en/prospective-student/graduate/applied-computing) at [UNISINOS University](http://www.unisinos.br/global/en).
